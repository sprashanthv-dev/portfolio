    "description": "Designed and developed a multi-threaded HTTP proxy server using C that parses and forwards the request to the intended HTTP server and relays the response. It supports the caching of requested web pages, reduces DNS look up times through hostname-ip address caching and IP blacklisting to block access to specified websites. Prefetching embedded links at the background improved the response times significantly.",
